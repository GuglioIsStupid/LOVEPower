# LoveWii

A bare minimum "Port" of love to the Wii. Based heavily off of [WiiLove](https://github.com/HTV04/WiiLove)

This port contains the bare minimum for my [Vocaloid Chance Ports](https://github.com/GuglioIsStupid/VocaloidChancePorts) to run

PR's are heavily appreaciated! I'm still new to this stuff

# Compiling

TODO

When compiling, its recommended to do the first build with ONLY `make`. After that you may do `make -j#`
