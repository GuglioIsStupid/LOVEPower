# LoveWii

A de-make of LÃ–VE2D to the Wii. Based heavily off of [WiiLove](https://github.com/HTV04/WiiLove)


PR's are heavily appreaciated! I'm still new to this stuff

# Compiling

TODO

When compiling, its recommended to do the first build with ONLY `make`. After that you may do `make -j#`

# TODO
- Implement wiimotes (love.wiimote)
- Implement Mii data (love.mii)
- Implement transforms (under love.graphics)
- Implement quads (under love.graphics)

Not in a specific order.
